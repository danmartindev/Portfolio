    Hi! I'm Dan and I'm a front end developer. I mainly focus on web and mobile development, 
    but I also have a lot of experience with game development and design. 
    I love learning new technologies and have been trying to 
    transition more into a full stack developer recently. 
    I am a fan of all types of media, but developing something new and 
    innovative is what really interests me. Whether that’s the next big web app, 
    a new mobile experience, or a game with unexplored mechanics, creating something 
    interesting is a goal for every project I work on.

        <h3>What I Like to Make</h3>
        <div>
          My favorite part of development is creating a user experience that is fluid, but also 
          makes the user stop and say, “I want to see that again”. Engagement can be improved 
          massively through a good user experience, whether that’s through an animation, a cool 
          presentation, or even a satisfying button click. Developing an experience that makes 
          the user want to interact with it regardless of the subject matter is always a fun 
          challenge for me.

        <h3>Games and More</h3>
        <div>
          Video games and board games have been a passion of mine for a long time. 
          I love both playing and designing games. The way that interactions and 
          mechanics of a game work is always a fascinating topic for me, and I love 
          to push the limits of what the designer originally intended them to do
          (especially when that designer is me).

        <h3>Staying Active</h3>
        <div>
            Being active and making healthy decisions is something that I strive to 
            do daily. While I love sitting back and watching Netflix as much as 
            anyone, I do like to balance that out by staying active. Whether that 
            means going to the gym, for a short run, or even just stretching, I always 
            make it a goal of my day to improve my physical and mental health.
