    Hi! I'm Dan and I'm a front end developer. I mainly focus on web and mobile development, 
    but I also have a lot of experience with game development and design. 
    I love learning new technologies and have been trying to 
    transition more into a full stack developer recently. 
    I am a fan of all types of media, but developing something new and 
    innovative is what really interests me. Whether thatâ€™s the next big web app, 
    a new mobile experience, or a game with unexplored mechanics, creating something 
    interesting is a goal for every project I work on.
